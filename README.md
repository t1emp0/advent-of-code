# Coding problems

In this repo you will find some of the coding problems I have done

AoC stands for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), a fun collection of challenges released yearly in December.
In the editions that I have participated, I had some friends to compete against.
Problems get increasingly hard as Christmas is getting closer.

[Advent of Corona](https://adventofcorona.hackersatupc.org) was a local spin-off of AoC that emerged as a result of the lockdown. It was an opportunity to learn and make friends since it was hosted by colleagues of the UPC.

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) is a well-know platform containing hundreds of categorized problems so that you can target the usage of specific data structures.

[NUWE](https://nuwe.io) is a young platform that creates tailor-made competitions so that companies can hire the best candidates.
It is also an opportunity for the candidates to get a grasp at what their future work will be like.
